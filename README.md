# DataRes F23 Research Coding Assessment

### Overall, just head over to [ResearchApps.ipynb], click on the "Open in Colab" button, save a copy of the notebook, and get to coding! After you're done, send us the files at sammy7shang@g.ucla.edu & lukasbroc@gmail.com with the subject "DataRes Research Applications," and you should get a confirmation email back if I'm free.

#### Remarks from Research Head

Howdy we're Lukas and Sammy and we're the Research heads for this quarter.  This is a quick assessment to just test basic proficiency with deep learning and libraries.

**We'll will teach you everything from the ground up. You just have to put in the effort and show that you want to learn.**

We just want to push this message across extremely heavily: we are not approaching these deep learning projects from the perspective of a data analyst or programmer; *we are approaching these projects with the mindset of a researcher.* Just like any biologist or scientist, we are going to dive deeply into novel literature regarding our field, and take existing technologies and extend them into applications of our liking. Just like a biologist looks at past studies, we will also look at recent studies regarding deep learning, and learn from them.

That is what makes the DataRes Research team different from other data science organizations. We are scientists first, and then programmers.

#### Thanks, Lukas and Sammy
